excerpt: "A product is not a miracle achieved overnight, but a process of continuous listening, refinement and evolution. After releasing the first version, we immediately received valuable user feedback and carried out two rapid iterations based on it."

## The first report from the battlefield: Practical test of v1.0.0 

After releasing the first version, we quickly received feedback from the earliest users within the team. While everyone recognizes the value of the tool, they also point out A core pain point: The way of separating individual cells with commas (,) will become very cumbersome when translating consecutive areas, such as from column A to column D. Do we have to write the column numbers one by one?

The wisdom of our users has given us direction. So, we embarked on rapid iteration:

v1.0.1: Firstly, the norms for using commas as delimiters were clarified, laying a solid foundation.

v1.0.2: Introduced a key feature - defining continuous ranges using a colon (:).

This small change has brought about a leap in operational efficiency. From now on, when translating A continuous range like column A to column D, there is no longer a need to input countless cell addresses. Just simply input A:D.

Review and Reflection

These two "point version" updates, though minor, are of great significance. It makes us deeply realize that

Users are the best mentors for products: The most genuine and urgent demands always come from the front-line usage scenarios.

The value of agility lies in response: We were not bound by the initial plan but made rapid adjustments based on feedback, making the tool more user-friendly and user-friendly within just a few weeks.

This convinces us that continuous listening and taking small but rapid steps are the best paths for a product to grow healthily.

This idea became the starting point of the File Translator project.

## The next preview

After polishing the core functions, our tool will undergo a major expansion in capabilities and officially support the translation of Word and PPT documents.. 

In the upcoming version, we rapidly iterated and added a "range function" and a more flexible way to select worksheets to the tool. Stay tuned for the next development log to see how we make this nascent tool even smarter and more powerful.
