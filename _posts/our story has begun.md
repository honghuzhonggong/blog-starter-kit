## The beginning:"Is there anything better than Google translate? "

In our daily work, our team has to deal with Excel and word files in English every day. We often encounter a cumbersome and time-consuming problem: manually copying the content of the worksheet to an online translation tool and then pasting it back into the table. Either upload the entire word document to Google translate, and then manually adjust the format, manually correct the content and professional terms. This process is not only prone to errors but also very inefficient. Moreover, doing it every day is particularly cumbersome and boring.

Another thorny issue is that the existing translation tools on the market, on the one hand, do not support the structure of word documents well enough and cannot fully recognize the original format and paragraphs; on the other hand, the translation quality is not good and lacks professional terms. So, an idea emerged: Could we develop a tool specifically for translating office documents? Leveraging the power of AI to enhance the quality of translation results? Isn't repetitive work supposed to be automated? I want to free up my team. I just want everyone to work more comfortably.

This idea became the starting point of the File Translator project.

## The regret of the first edition and the blueprint for the future

In v1.0.0, we clearly know that there are still many things left undone:

The interface is still very simple.

Word and PPT are not supported.

There are no advanced features such as bilingual output or format retention.

The error handling mechanism is still relatively fragile.

But, this is precisely the beauty of the starting point. We now have a tool that can actually operate and solve specific problems. It's like a freshly assembled engine. Although it doesn't have a luxurious body or comfortable seats yet, it can already roar and drive.

## The next preview

On the day v1.0.0 was released, the excitement of the team was beyond words. When we first select a cell range in the tool, click "Translate", and then see the accurate translation instantly fill the target position, we know that a brand-new path has already unfolded beneath our feet.

This is not merely the birth of a tool; it is the beginning of our team putting ideas into practice and solving practical problems with code. The road ahead is long, but we have already set out. 

In the upcoming version, we rapidly iterated and added a "range function" and a more flexible way to select worksheets to the tool. Stay tuned for the next development log to see how we make this nascent tool even smarter and more powerful.
