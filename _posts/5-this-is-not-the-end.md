## Towards becoming an intelligent and stable professional translation partner

In v1.6.0, we reached a milestone: the first version of the direct translation function for PDF. Due to its fixed layout and complex structure, PDF has always been a difficult point in the field of document processing. We tried many methods, starting with supporting simple text, images and tables. Through continuous optimization of several versions - improving layout analysis, recognizing text alignment, and supporting cell merging - we eventually enabled File Translator to have the ability to handle this "ultimate form" of documents.


## Become a truly "configurable" platform

We realize that a professional tool must be able to adapt to the ever-changing needs of users. Therefore, we have carried out a series of upgrades to grant users "control" :

Custom color schemes: Make the interface more in line with personal aesthetics.

Flexible terminology and domain management: Users can freely add, edit and export their own professional vocabulary lists, making the translation results more accurate.

Model free editing: Supports users to add and manage AI translation models according to their own needs, breaking the boundaries of functions.

## Delve deeply into intelligence and automation

The truth is revealed in the details. We make the tools smarter and more sensible:

It will automatically detect the network environment and intelligently select the configuration loading path.

It can verify the file format and avoid potential errors before translation begins.

It can remember the user's preferences, prevent the software interface from going out of the screen, and automatically display updated content when starting up.

## The end of one journey, the beginning of next

From v1.0.0 to v1.7.6, the functional iteration of KB Translator for Windows has been successfully completed at this moment. This is not the end of the story, but rather a semicolon we have drawn for this journey of focus and in-depth exploration.

As Churchill said, "Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."

We will restructure the project to make it cross-platform, allowing the core experience of File Translator to break through the boundaries of Windows and run smoothly on macOS, Linux, browser, iOS and Android.
