title: "Making It Better"
excerpt: "After the basic framework of the tool was solidified, we entered the "polishing" stage. The updates during this period are no longer merely about adding functions from scratch, but rather about elevating the experience and delving deeper into problems from having to being better. At this stage, we are committed to making every function transform from "usable" to "user-friendly"."

## An experience Revolution from "usable" to "user-friendly"

At this stage, we are committed to making every function transform from "usable" to "user-friendly".

The "invisible" evolution of user experience
Many updates, though not eye-catching, are of vital importance:

v1.4.0: Added both Chinese and English interfaces, and allowed for adjusting the form size, meeting the preferences of international teams and different users for interface layout.

v1.4.4: Font Settings have been added for Word and PPT translations. Users can choose the Chinese and Western fonts used in the translated documents to ensure visual consistency.

v1.4.5: Added the option of "Whether the save path is the same as the input file path", granting users more control over the output.

v1.5.0: We have added a right-click menu to the reference glossary, supporting quick addition and deletion of terms. This minor change has greatly enhanced the efficiency of users in managing professional terms.

## The "soul" of document translation: Retain the format

This is one of the areas where we have devoted the most energy.

In the early versions, after translating Word/PPT, all formats would be lost, as if the document had lost its "soul", and manual adjustments to the format and style were required. At this stage, we made a major breakthrough, achieving perfect retention of bold, italic, underline, text color and highlighting. The translated document is no longer just plain text but retains its original professional appearance. Reducing repetitive work has always been our unchanging original aspiration.

## Bilingual output and thoughtful details

We deeply understand the need of professional users to refer to the original text. Therefore, we have not only launched a bilingual output function, but also meticulously optimized the line break logic of the main text paragraphs to ensure that the Chinese and English translations are clear and not confusing. Meanwhile, the addition of a series of considerate features such as right-clicking to manage terms and customizing interface languages has elevated the ease of use of the tool to a new level.

## From tools to partners

From v1.2.9 to v1.5.0, File Translator has undergone an on-site evolution. We focus on solving those "invisible" but highly influential experience issues, making tools smarter, more reliable and more user-friendly. It is gradually evolving from a functional tool into an intelligent assistant that understands users' minds.

## The next preview

In the next stage, File Translator will challenge the "ultimate form" in the document field - direct translation of PDFS, and will undergo the most significant architectural and experience upgrade since its birth. A brand-new storm is about to come.
