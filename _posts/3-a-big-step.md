excerpt: "Once a core function is verified, the pace of innovation cannot stop. After Excel translation gradually stabilized, we began to consider a more ambitious blueprint: Could Word and PowerPoint also enjoy the convenience of AI translation? This time, we have embarked on a journey of multi-front operations."

## Multi-front operations from Excel to Word and PPT

After the Excel translation function became stable, we witnessed the first major capability expansion of File Translator. Our goal is to transform it from a tool adept at handling tables into a versatile one capable of handling various office scenarios.

Version v1.1.0 marks that we have officially provided initial translation support for Word and PowerPoint. This step may seem simple, but in fact, it leads into a completely new realm. Unlike structured Excel, Word and PPT are filled with complex formats, text boxes and diverse objects. How to accurately extract text and maintain its basic structure is the primary challenge we face.


## A comprehensive upgrade of the "heart" and "face"

While expanding the types of documents, we are also making every effort to upgrade the core and appearance of the tool

The model ecosystem is more diverse: We have successively integrated mainstream models such as DeepSeek and GLM, providing users with more diverse and reliable choices.

Performance has been significantly enhanced: By introducing multi-threading technology, we have increased the translation speed of long documents several times over.

A brand-new interface: Version v1.2.6 introduces a completely new UI interface. This is not merely a visual beautification, but a thorough reconstruction of the interaction logic, paving the way for the explosive growth of future functions.

## The next preview

From v1.1.0 to v1.2.7, File Translator has undergone a crucial transformation from a "single-function tool" to a "comprehensive translation assistant". Supporting multiple document types, offering a variety of model options, and featuring a modern interface - a lightweight yet comprehensive office translation platform has taken shape.

In the next stage, we will further refine each function to make image translation more practical and format retention more perfect. File Translator will enter its "meticulous refinement" period.
